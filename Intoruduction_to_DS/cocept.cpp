------------------------Data Structure-----------------------

1. What is that
=>
Data Structurte :- It is a way of organising and storing the data
                   in such a way, that it helps in efficient
                   storage, retitrieval, deletion and updation of data.

                   It helps in problem solving

2. Why do we need to learn that
=> To be able to solve coding questions in interviews and online assesgemnt
   once you are able to solve questions......your chances to secure a good
   paying job (10+ LPA) will rise by almost 90 percent.

3. How to learn
=> From CodeVerse academy by Akash Kanni....



-------------------------Catogories of Data Structure---------------------

primitive DS :- These are pre-existing (already defined/avaialable data structures)
                easy to use
                less-complex
                fixed size
Example : Int - 4 Bytes, float - 8 Bytes, boolean, char, double

non-primitve (derived) DS :- These are derived data structures which uses primitve ds
                             as part of it.
                             Array
                             stack
                             queue
                             linked-list
                             graph
                             tree


                             Hash table
                             Hashmap
                             trie

   
   -------------------------------Types of non-linear Data structures--------------------
            
1. Linear Data structure : In linear DS elements are stores in sequential order
                           every element is connected to one previous and one next element 
                           (
                            exept the first and last one
                            first element is only connected to one next element
                            last element is only connected to one previous element
                           )

                           Traversal on elements is easy
                           simpler to implement
                           Memory can be contiguos (Array, stack, queue) or non-contiguos (linked-list)

2. Non-Linear DS : In non linear DS the elements gets stored in heirarchical order
                   there can be multiple paths of traversal
                   Complex to understand
                   difficult in implementation

                   (From interview point of view......--> This is very very important)

                   Tree
                   Graph
                   HashMap
                   Heap
